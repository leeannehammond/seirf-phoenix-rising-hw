# Weekend & Winter Break Break HW

## Getting Started

You get out of this course, whatever you put into it. This winter break, is a fairly unique opporunity to start figuring out how you learn and stay motivated on your own.

Suggestions:

  - Figure out how much time you want to spend a day (maybe 1 hour a day? Don't overdo it! It's better to do a little bit than get overwhelmed and do none of it)
  - Take this extra time to work on your homework and get it done early - even though it isn't due until Jan 8th. Get the jump on it! And you can take your time working through it.
  - Make a list of level up goals and prioritize what is most important to you

- Here are some level-up options:

  - Get more comfortable with Terminal
    - [Watch these videos and code along](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdnONIhPScSToZztXRHyKZTQEsE30luMx)
    - [Terminal Cheatsheet](../../cheatsheets/Terminal-Cheatsheet.md)

  - CSS Practice
    - [Watch these videos](../../cheatsheets/HTML-CSS-Review-Videos.md) - feel free to review or check out new ones
    - [Work on 1 or more recommended projects](../../cheatsheets/HTML-CSS-Review-Videos.md#recommended-projects)

  - JavaScript Solidify Fundamentals
    - Read the first 1-6 Chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
        - Alternatives (not free)
          - [`A Smarter Way To Learn JavaScript` by Mike Myers](http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/js/index-of-exercises.html) and
          - [`Learn JavaScript & jQuery` by Jon Ducket](http://javascriptbook.com/)
    - Try the problems at the back of each chapter of Eloquent Javascript
    - Go back to lab and hw problems you didn't have time to solve and try them again
    - [Try the free coderbyte challenges](https://coderbyte.com/challenges)
    - [Keep going with project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
    - [Sign up for Code Wars](www.codewars.com/r/bEqEeQ) - the newsletter sends `Coffee and kata` - a weekly curated list of interesting challenges from all levels

  - Putting it All together (HTML, CSS, JS)
    - Make a game! Some games that will be challenging but possible with the time you have and the skills you've built so far:
     - Memory Game - like fundamentals but randomize the cards, add more cards, and more functionality
     - Rock Paper Scissors in the browser
     - Tomagochi - also the day we did classes it was the morning bonus
     - Castle Battle - a Matt Huntington classic! As fun as Landscaper or even more!
     - Hangman - it was an afternoon bonus the day we did classes - you can make it in the console or in the DOM
     - Make landscaper playable with the DOM!



## Tips for Staying Motivated
  - Make a modest plan (like 1 hour a day)
  - Remember you are on your own but you are not alone
    - schedule zoom rooms and work together on something
    - talk to each other on what you are working on and try doing one thing on your own and one thing someone else is excited about and then compare how you approached it/solved it/what you learned

## Submission Guidelines

1. You can do this work anywhere. If you would like to have it reviewed by an IA, you must put it somewhere on github.
